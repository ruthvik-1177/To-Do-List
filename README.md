# To-Do-List
This document presents a simple To-Do List program implemented in C. 
The program allows users to add tasks, mark tasks as completed, and view the list of tasks. 
Tasks are stored in an array, and their status is tracked using a parallel array of completion flags. 
The program provides a basic menu interface for interacting with the task list.
